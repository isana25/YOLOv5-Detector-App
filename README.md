# YOLOv5 Object Detector

A simple web app for real-time object detection and explanation using the pre-trained YOLOv5 model.
---

## Overview

This app uses the **YOLOv5s** model pre-trained on the **COCO dataset** (80 object classes) for detecting objects in user-uploaded images. The model is loaded directly from the [Ultralytics GitHub repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) via `torch.hub`.
